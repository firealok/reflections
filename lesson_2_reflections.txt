What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repo, some meta files are added to the repository
to track changes and history through commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate stage between the working directory
and the repository. It provides the user with more control as the user
can choose which files to commit and which not to.
